ADRD Tool Documentation
===================================

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning framework for the differential diagnosis of dementia etiologies using multi-modal data.

Using data from **9** distinct cohorts totalling **50,686** participants, we developed an algorithmic framework, utilizing transformers and self-supervised learning, to execute differential diagnoses of dementia. This model classifies individuals into one or more of thirteen meticulously curated diagnostic categories, each aligning closely with real-world clinical requirements. These categories span the entire spectrum of cognitive conditions, from normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia (DE), and further include **10** dementia types.

..
   **Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
   that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
   It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
   and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

   Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
   how to :ref:`installation` the project.
